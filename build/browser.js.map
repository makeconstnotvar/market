It\n     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is\n     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling\n     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n     * thought.\n     *\n     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n     * following ways.\n     *\n     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n     * be left uncaught.\n     *\n     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n     *\n     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n     * up all resources that an Observable used.

If this information is new, please navigate to the\n * {\\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better\n * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\\@link state state} and\n * {\\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression\n * bound to the trigger changes.\n *\n * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the\n * {\\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element\n * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that\n * the\n * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\\@triggerName]=\"expression\"`.\n *\n * Animation trigger bindings strigify values and then match the previous and current values against\n * any linked transitions. If a boolean value is provided into the trigger binding then it will both\n * be represented as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false` for a true and false boolean values\n * respectively.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The\n * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\\@link state state} and\n * {\\@link transition transition} declarations.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *       state(...),\n *       state(...),\n *       transition(...),\n *       transition(...)\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"something\";\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * ## Disable Animations\n * A special animation control binding called `\\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will\n * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as\n * any animations on the element itself.\n *\n * When true, the `\\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example\n * below shows how to use this feature:\n *\n * ```ts\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   template: `\n *     <div [\\@.disabled]=\"isDisabled\">\n *       <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   `,\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"childAnimation\", [\n *       // ...\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   isDisabled = true;\n *   exp = '...';\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The `\\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\\@.disabled` prevents it from happening\n * (when true).\n *\n * Note that `\\@.disbled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on\n * the same element will also be disabled).\n *\n * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide\n * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will\n * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular\n * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular\n * component.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\\@angular/core';\n *\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'app-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',\n * })\n * class AppComponent {\n *   \\@HostBinding('\\@.disabled')\n *   public animationsDisabled = true;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?\n * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\\@link query query} for inner\n * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit. This is\n * also the case for when a sub animation is queried by a parent and then later animated using {\\@link\n * animateChild animateChild}.\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} name\n * @param {?} definitions\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction trigger$1(name, definitions) {\n    return { type: 7 /* Trigger */, name: name, definitions: definitions, options: {} };\n}\n/**\n * `animate` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given\n * amount of time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected\n * to be used within {\\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\\@link group group}, or {\\@link\n * transition transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional delay\n * and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n * delay=100, easing=ease-out`. If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the\n * `duration` value in millisecond form.\n * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\\@link style style} or {\\@link\n * keyframes keyframes}. If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected\n * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by\n * {\\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} timings\n * @param {?=} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction animate$1(timings, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    return { type: 4 /* Animate */, styles: styles, timings: timings };\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

In other words, if a transition\n * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be\n * triggered.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n *   // animation has fully completed itself\n *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *\n *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *     animate(500)\n *   ]),\n *\n *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n *\n *   // you can also go full out and include a function\n *   transition((fromState, toState) => {\n *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked\n *     return fromState == \"off\" && toState == \"on\";\n *   }, animate(\"1s 0s\"))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * #### The final `animate` call\n *\n * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a\n * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc\n * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Using :enter and :leave\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`\n * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*\n * => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ]),\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Boolean values\n * if a trigger binding value is a boolean value then it can be matched using a transition\n * expression that compares `true` and `false` or `1` and `0`.\n *\n * ```\n * // in the template\n * <div [\\@openClose]=\"open ? true : false\">...</div>\n *\n * // in the component metadata\n * trigger('openClose', [\n *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),\n *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),\n *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Using :increment and :decrement\n * In addition to the :enter and :leave transition aliases, the :increment and :decrement aliases\n * can be used to kick off a transition when a numeric value has increased or decreased in value.\n *\n * ```\n * import {group, animate, query, transition, style, trigger} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * import {Component} from '\\@angular/core';\n *\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'banner-carousel-component',\n *   styles: [`\n *     .banner-container {\n *        position:relative;\n *        height:500px;\n *        overflow:hidden;\n *      }\n *     .banner-container > .banner {\n *        position:absolute;\n *        left:0;\n *        top:0;\n *        font-size:200px;\n *        line-height:500px;\n *        font-weight:bold;\n *        text-align:center;\n *        width:100%;\n *      }\n *   `],\n *   template: `\n *     <button (click)=\"previous()\">Previous</button>\n *     <button (click)=\"next()\">Next</button>\n *     <hr>\n *     <div [\\@bannerAnimation]=\"selectedIndex\" class=\"banner-container\">\n *       <div class=\"banner\"> {{ banner }} </div>\n *     </div>\n *   `\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('bannerAnimation', [\n *       transition(\":increment\", group([\n *         query(':enter', [\n *           style({ left: '100%' }),\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))\n *         ]),\n *         query(':leave', [\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '-100%' }))\n *         ])\n *       ])),\n *       transition(\":decrement\", group([\n *         query(':enter', [\n *           style({ left: '-100%' }),\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))\n *         ]),\n *         query(':leave', [\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '100%' }))\n *         ])\n *       ])),\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class BannerCarouselComponent {\n *   allBanners: string[] = ['1', '2', '3', '4'];\n *   selectedIndex: number = 0;\n *\n *   get banners() {\n *      return [this.allBanners[this.selectedIndex]];\n *   }\n *\n *   previous() {\n *     this.selectedIndex = Math.max(this.selectedIndex - 1, 0);\n *   }\n *\n *   next() {\n *     this.selectedIndex = Math.min(this.selectedIndex + 1, this.allBanners.length - 1);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction transition$1(stateChangeExpr, steps, options) {\n    if (options === void 0) { options = null; }\n    return { type: 1 /* Transition */, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps, options: options };\n}\n/**\n * `animation` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.\n *\n * `var myAnimation = animation(...)` is designed to produce a reusable animation that can be later\n * invoked in another animation or sequence.

It works by allowing a queried element to execute its own\n * animation within the animation sequence.\n *\n * Each time an animation is triggered in angular, the parent animation\n * will always get priority and any child animations will be blocked. In order\n * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements\n * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.\n *\n * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation\n * triggers that will execute at the same time.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->\n * <button (click)=\"exp =! exp\">Toggle</button>\n * <hr>\n *\n * <div [\\@parentAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *   <header>Hello</header>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       one\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       two\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       three\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate\n * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations\n * can also fire:\n *\n * ```ts\n * // parent-child.component.ts\n * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'parent-child-component',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('parentAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         query('header', [\n *           style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *         ]),\n *         query('\\@childAnimation', [\n *           animateChild()\n *         ])\n *       ])\n *     ]),\n *     trigger('childAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *       ])\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class ParentChildCmp {\n *   exp: boolean = false;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to\n * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the\n * `\\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.\n *\n * This example can be further extended by using stagger:\n *\n * ```ts\n * query('\\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [\n *   animateChild()\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.\n *\n * ## The first frame of child animations\n * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the\n * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence. This way\n * the parent animation does not need to set any initial styling data on the sub elements before the\n * sub animations kick off.\n *\n * In the example above the first frame of the `childAnimation`'s `false => true` transition\n * consists of a style of `opacity: 0`. This is applied immediately when the `parentAnimation`\n * animation transition sequence starts. Only then when the `\\@childAnimation` is queried and called\n * with `animateChild` will it then animate to its destination of `opacity: 1`.\n *\n * Note that this feature designed to be used alongside {\\@link query query()} and it will only work\n * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation DSL (this means that CSS keyframes\n * and transitions are not handled by this API).\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\n\n/**\n * `useAnimation` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

The symbols should be replaced by the\n * local equivalents, using the Number Symbols for your language.\n *\n * Here are the special characters used in number patterns:\n *\n * | Symbol | Meaning |\n * |--------|---------|\n * | . | Replaced automatically by the character used for the decimal point. |\n * | , | Replaced by the \"grouping\" (thousands) separator. |\n * | 0 | Replaced by a digit (or zero if there aren't enough digits). |\n * | # | Replaced by a digit (or nothing if there aren't enough). |\n * | ¤ | This will be replaced by a currency symbol, such as $ or USD. |\n * | % | This marks a percent format. The % symbol may change position, but must be retained. |\n * | E | This marks a scientific format. The E symbol may change position, but must be retained. |\n * | ' | Special characters used as literal characters are quoted with ASCII single quotes. |\n *\n * You can find more information\n * [on the CLDR website](http://cldr.unicode.org/translation/number-patterns)\n *\n * \\@experimental i18n support is experimental.\n * @param {?} locale\n * @param {?} type\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction getLocaleNumberFormat(locale, type) {\n    var /** @type {?} */ data = findLocaleData(locale);\n    return data[14 /* NumberFormats */][type];\n}\n/**\n * The symbol used to represent the currency for the main country using this locale (e.g. $ for\n * the locale en-US).\n * The symbol will be `null` if the main country cannot be determined.\n *\n * \\@experimental i18n support is experimental.\n * @param {?} locale\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction getLocaleCurrencySymbol(locale) {\n    var /** @type {?} */ data = findLocaleData(locale);\n    return data[15 /* CurrencySymbol */] || null;\n}\n/**\n * The name of the currency for the main country using this locale (e.g. USD for the locale\n * en-US).\n * The name will be `null` if the main country cannot be determined.\n *\n * \\@experimental i18n support is experimental.\n * @param {?} locale\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction getLocaleCurrencyName(locale) {\n    var /** @type {?} */ data = findLocaleData(locale);\n    return data[16 /* CurrencyName */] || null;\n}\n/**\n * The locale plural function used by ICU expressions to determine the plural case to use.\n * See {\\@link NgPlural} for more information.\n *\n * \\@experimental i18n support is experimental.\n * @param {?} locale\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction getLocalePluralCase(locale) {\n    var /** @type {?} */ data = findLocaleData(locale);\n    return data[17 /* PluralCase */];\n}\n/**\n * @param {?} data\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction checkFullData(data) {\n    if (!data[18 /* ExtraData */]) {\n        throw new Error(\"Missing extra locale data for the locale \\\"\" + data[0 /* LocaleId */] + \"\\\".

Defaults to the injector of the current view container.\n *\n * * `ngComponentOutletContent`: Optional list of projectable nodes to insert into the content\n * section of the component, if exists.\n *\n * * `ngComponentOutletNgModuleFactory`: Optional module factory to allow dynamically loading other\n * module, then load a component from that module.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * Simple\n * ```\n * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet=\"componentTypeExpression\"></ng-container>\n * ```\n *\n * Customized injector/content\n * ```\n * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet=\"componentTypeExpression;\n *                                   injector: injectorExpression;\n *                                   content: contentNodesExpression;\">\n * </ng-container>\n * ```\n *\n * Customized ngModuleFactory\n * ```\n * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet=\"componentTypeExpression;\n *                                   ngModuleFactory: moduleFactory;\">\n * </ng-container>\n * ```\n * ## Example\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngComponentOutlet/ts/module.ts region='SimpleExample'}\n *\n * A more complete example with additional options:\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngComponentOutlet/ts/module.ts region='CompleteExample'}\n * A more complete example with ngModuleFactory:\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngComponentOutlet/ts/module.ts region='NgModuleFactoryExample'}\n *\n * \\@experimental\n */\nvar NgComponentOutlet = (function () {\n    function NgComponentOutlet(_viewContainerRef) {\n        this._viewContainerRef = _viewContainerRef;\n        this._componentRef = null;\n        this._moduleRef = null;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgComponentOutlet.prototype.ngOnChanges = /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (changes) {\n        this._viewContainerRef.clear();\n        this._componentRef = null;\n        if (this.ngComponentOutlet) {\n            var /** @type {?} */ elInjector = this.ngComponentOutletInjector || this._viewContainerRef.parentInjector;\n            if (changes['ngComponentOutletNgModuleFactory']) {\n                if (this._moduleRef)\n                    this._moduleRef.destroy();\n                if (this.ngComponentOutletNgModuleFactory) {\n                    var /** @type {?} */ parentModule = elInjector.get(NgModuleRef);\n                    this._moduleRef = this.ngComponentOutletNgModuleFactory.create(parentModule.injector);\n                }\n                else {\n                    this._moduleRef = null;\n                }\n            }\n            var /** @type {?} */ componentFactoryResolver = this._moduleRef ? this._moduleRef.componentFactoryResolver :\n                elInjector.get(ComponentFactoryResolver);\n            var /** @type {?} */ componentFactory = componentFactoryResolver.resolveComponentFactory(this.ngComponentOutlet);\n            this._componentRef = this._viewContainerRef.createComponent(componentFactory, this._viewContainerRef.length, elInjector, this.ngComponentOutletContent);\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgComponentOutlet.prototype.ngOnDestroy = /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function () {\n        if (this._moduleRef)\n            this._moduleRef.destroy();\n    };\n    NgComponentOutlet.decorators = [\n        { type: Directive, args: [{ selector: '[ngComponentOutlet]' },] },\n    ];\n    /** @nocollapse */\n    NgComponentOutlet.ctorParameters = function () { return [\n        { type: ViewContainerRef, },\n    ]; };\n    NgComponentOutlet.propDecorators = {\n        \"ngComponentOutlet\": [{ type: Input },],\n        \"ngComponentOutletInjector\": [{ type: Input },],\n        \"ngComponentOutletContent\": [{ type: Input },],\n        \"ngComponentOutletNgModuleFactory\": [{ type: Input },],\n    };\n    return NgComponentOutlet;\n}());\n\n/**\n * @fileoverview added by tsickle\n * @suppress {checkTypes} checked by tsc\n */\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).\n * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n *\n * ```\n * <li *ngFor=\"let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst\">\n *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf=\"isFirst\">default</span>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n *\n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgForOf` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n *\n * With `<ng-template>` element:\n *\n * ```\n * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar NgForOf = (function () {\n    function NgForOf(_viewContainer, _template, _differs) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgForOf.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        get: /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (fn) {\n            if (isDevMode() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n                if (/** @type {?} */ (console) && /** @type {?} */ (console.warn)) {\n                    console.warn(\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn) + \". \" +\n                        \"See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.\");\n                }\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgForOf.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (value) {\n            // TODO(TS2.1): make TemplateRef<Partial<NgForRowOf<T>>> once we move to TS v2.1\n            // The current type is too restrictive; a template that just uses index, for example,\n            // should be acceptable.\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgForOf.prototype.ngOnChanges = /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (/** @type {?} */ e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.

Typically the:\n *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.\n *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.\n *\n * ## Most common usage\n *\n * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as\n * seen in this example:\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}\n *\n * ## Showing an alternative template using `else`\n *\n * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template\n * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n *\n * ## Using non-inlined `then` template\n *\n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n *\n * ## Storing conditional result in a variable\n *\n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in following example:\n *\n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n *\n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n *\n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n *\n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n *\n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock\">...</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with a `then` and `else` block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock\"></div>\n * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with storing the value locally:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition as value; else elseBlock\">{{value}}</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar NgIf = (function () {\n    function NgIf(_viewContainer, templateRef) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._context = new NgIfContext();\n        this._thenTemplateRef = null;\n        this._elseTemplateRef = null;\n        this._thenViewRef = null;\n        this._elseViewRef = null;\n        this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIf\", {\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} condition\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (condition) {\n            this._context.$implicit = this._context.ngIf = condition;\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIfThen\", {\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} templateRef\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (templateRef) {\n            this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n            this._thenViewRef = null; // clear previous view if any.\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIfElse\", {\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} templateRef\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (templateRef) {\n            this._elseTemplateRef = templateRef;\n            this._elseViewRef = null; // clear previous view if any.\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgIf.prototype._updateView = /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function () {\n        if (this._context.$implicit) {\n            if (!this._thenViewRef) {\n                this._viewContainer.clear();\n                this._elseViewRef = null;\n                if (this._thenTemplateRef) {\n                    this._thenViewRef =\n                        this._viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this._thenTemplateRef, this._context);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            if (!this._elseViewRef) {\n                this._viewContainer.clear();\n                this._thenViewRef = null;\n                if (this._elseTemplateRef) {\n                    this._elseViewRef =\n                        this._viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this._elseTemplateRef, this._context);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    NgIf.decorators = [\n        { type: Directive, args: [{ selector: '[ngIf]' },] },\n    ];\n    /** @nocollapse */\n    NgIf.ctorParameters = function () { return [\n        { type: ViewContainerRef, },\n        { type: TemplateRef, },\n    ]; };\n    NgIf.propDecorators = {\n        \"ngIf\": [{ type: Input },],\n        \"ngIfThen\": [{ type: Input },],\n        \"ngIfElse\": [{ type: Input },],\n    };\n    return NgIf;\n}());\n/**\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar NgIfContext = (function () {\n    function NgIfContext() {\n        this.$implicit = null;\n        this.ngIf = null;\n    }\n    return NgIfContext;\n}());\n\n/**\n * @fileoverview added by tsickle\n * @suppress {checkTypes} checked by tsc\n */\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

If the url changes, the class will be removed.\n *\n * You can set more than one class, as follows:\n *\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive=\"class1 class2\">Bob</a>\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" [routerLinkActive]=\"['class1', 'class2']\">Bob</a>\n * ```\n *\n * You can configure RouterLinkActive by passing `exact: true`. This will add the classes\n * only when the url matches the link exactly.\n *\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive=\"active-link\" [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{exact:\n * true}\">Bob</a>\n * ```\n *\n * You can assign the RouterLinkActive instance to a template variable and directly check\n * the `isActive` status.\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive #rla=\"routerLinkActive\">\n *   Bob {{ rla.isActive ? '(already open)' : ''}}\n * </a>\n * ```\n *\n * Finally, you can apply the RouterLinkActive directive to an ancestor of a RouterLink.\n *\n * ```\n * <div routerLinkActive=\"active-link\" [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{exact: true}\">\n *   <a routerLink=\"/user/jim\">Jim</a>\n *   <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\">Bob</a>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * This will set the active-link class on the div tag if the url is either '/user/jim' or\n * '/user/bob'.\n *\n * \\@ngModule RouterModule\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar RouterLinkActive = (function () {\n    function RouterLinkActive(router, element, renderer, cdr) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.router = router;\n        this.element = element;\n        this.renderer = renderer;\n        this.cdr = cdr;\n        this.classes = [];\n        this.isActive = false;\n        this.routerLinkActiveOptions = { exact: false };\n        this.subscription = router.events.subscribe(function (s) {\n            if (s instanceof NavigationEnd) {\n                _this.update();\n            }\n        });\n    }\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RouterLinkActive.prototype.ngAfterContentInit = /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function () {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.links.changes.subscribe(function (_) { return _this.update();

You do\n * **not** need to add a special selector to activate it.\n *\n * ### How to use select controls with form directives\n *\n * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`\n * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.\n *\n * If your option values are simple strings, you can bind to the normal `value` property\n * on the option.  If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * ### Caveat: Option selection\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n *\n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.\n * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.\n *\n * #### Syntax\n *\n * ```\n * <select [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [(ngModel)]=\"selectedCountries\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n *\n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n        this._compareWith = ɵlooseIdentical;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype, \"compareWith\", {\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"compareWith must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._compareWith = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\n        if (id == null) {\n            this._renderer.setProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n        }\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n        this._renderer.setProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n            _this.value = _this._getOptionValue(valueString);\n            fn(_this.value);\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /** @internal */\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function () { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); };\n    /** @internal */\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (this._compareWith(this._optionMap.get(id), value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /** @internal */\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (valueString) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = _extractId(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n *\n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select multiple>` supports `compareWith`\n * input. `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects options by the return value of the function.\n *\n * #### Syntax\n *\n * ```\n * <select multiple [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [(ngModel)]=\"selectedCountries\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n *\n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    function SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n        this._compareWith = ɵlooseIdentical;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype, \"compareWith\", {\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"compareWith must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._compareWith = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (value) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ optionSelectedStateSetter;\n        if (Array.isArray(value)) {\n            // convert values to ids\n            var /** @type {?} */ ids_1 = value.map(function (v) { return _this._getOptionId(v);

Example:\n *\n * ```ts\n * const ctrl = new FormControl('some value');\n * console.log(ctrl.value);     // 'some value'\n * ```\n *\n * You can also initialize the control with a form state object on instantiation,\n * which includes both the value and whether or not the control is disabled.\n * You can't use the value key without the disabled key; both are required\n * to use this way of initialization.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const ctrl = new FormControl({value: 'n/a', disabled: true});\n * console.log(ctrl.value);     // 'n/a'\n * console.log(ctrl.status);   // 'DISABLED'\n * ```\n *\n * The second {\\@link FormControl} argument can accept one of three things:\n * * a sync validator function\n * * an array of sync validator functions\n * * an options object containing validator and/or async validator functions\n *\n * Example of a single sync validator function:\n *\n * ```ts\n * const ctrl = new FormControl('', Validators.required);\n * console.log(ctrl.value);     // ''\n * console.log(ctrl.status);   // 'INVALID'\n * ```\n *\n * Example using options object:\n *\n * ```ts\n * const ctrl = new FormControl('', {\n *    validators: Validators.required,\n *    asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * The options object can also be used to define when the control should update.\n * By default, the value and validity of a control updates whenever the value\n * changes. You can configure it to update on the blur event instead by setting\n * the `updateOn` option to `'blur'`.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const c = new FormControl('', { updateOn: 'blur' });\n * ```\n *\n * You can also set `updateOn` to `'submit'`, which will delay value and validity\n * updates until the parent form of the control fires a submit event.\n *\n * See its superclass, {\\@link AbstractControl}, for more properties and methods.\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar FormControl = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormControl, _super);\n    function FormControl(formState, validatorOrOpts, asyncValidator) {\n        if (formState === void 0) { formState = null; }\n        var _this = _super.call(this, coerceToValidator(validatorOrOpts), coerceToAsyncValidator(asyncValidator, validatorOrOpts)) || this;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        _this._onChange = [];\n        _this._applyFormState(formState);\n        _this._setUpdateStrategy(validatorOrOpts);\n        _this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n        _this._initObservables();\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Set the value of the form control to `value`.\n     *\n     * If `onlySelf` is `true`, this change will only affect the validation of this `FormControl`\n     * and not its parent component.

It calculates its status by reducing the statuses\n * of its children. For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire\n * group becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormGroup` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {\\@link FormControl} and {\\@link FormArray}.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * When instantiating a {\\@link FormGroup}, pass in a collection of child controls as the first\n * argument. The key for each child will be the name under which it is registered.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const form = new FormGroup({\n *   first: new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   last: new FormControl('Drew'),\n * });\n *\n * console.log(form.value);   // {first: 'Nancy', last; 'Drew'}\n * console.log(form.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n *\n * You can also include group-level validators as the second arg, or group-level async\n * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const form = new FormGroup({\n *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n * }, passwordMatchValidator);\n *\n *\n * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {\n *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value\n *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Like {\\@link FormControl} instances, you can alternatively choose to pass in\n * validators and async validators as part of an options object.\n *\n * ```\n * const form = new FormGroup({\n *   password: new FormControl('')\n *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('')\n * }, {validators: passwordMatchValidator, asyncValidators: otherValidator});\n * ```\n *\n * The options object can also be used to set a default value for each child\n * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the\n * group level, all child controls will default to 'blur', unless the child\n * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const c = new FormGroup({\n *    one: new FormControl()\n * }, {updateOn: 'blur'});\n * ```\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar FormGroup = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormGroup, _super);\n    function FormGroup(controls, validatorOrOpts, asyncValidator) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this, coerceToValidator(validatorOrOpts), coerceToAsyncValidator(asyncValidator, validatorOrOpts)) || this;\n        _this.controls = controls;\n        _this._initObservables();\n        _this._setUpdateStrategy(validatorOrOpts);\n        _this._setUpControls();\n        _this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n     *\n     * This method does not update the value or validity of the control, so for most cases you'll want\n     * to use {@link FormGroup#addControl addControl} instead.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n     *\n     * This method does not update the value or validity of the control, so for most cases you'll want\n     * to use {\\@link FormGroup#addControl addControl} instead.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.registerControl = /**\n     * Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n     *\n     * This method does not update the value or validity of the control, so for most cases you'll want\n     * to use {\\@link FormGroup#addControl addControl} instead.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            return this.controls[name];\n        this.controls[name] = control;\n        control.setParent(this);\n        control._registerOnCollectionChange(this._onCollectionChange);\n        return control;\n    };\n    /**\n     * Add a control to this group.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Add a control to this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.addControl = /**\n     * Add a control to this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (name, control) {\n        this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Remove a control from this group.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Remove a control from this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.removeControl = /**\n     * Remove a control from this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (name) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.setControl = /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        if (control)\n            this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Check whether there is an enabled control with the given name in the group.\n     *\n     * It will return false for disabled controls.

For example, if one of\n * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {\\@link FormControl} and {\\@link FormGroup}.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * When instantiating a {\\@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first\n * argument.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   new FormControl('Drew'),\n * ]);\n *\n * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']\n * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n *\n * You can also include array-level validators and async validators. These come in handy\n * when you want to perform validation that considers the value of more than one child\n * control.\n *\n * The two types of validators can be passed in separately as the second and third arg\n * respectively, or together as part of an options object.\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy'),\n *   new FormControl('Drew')\n * ], {validators: myValidator, asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator});\n * ```\n *\n * The options object can also be used to set a default value for each child\n * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the\n * array level, all child controls will default to 'blur', unless the child\n * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const c = new FormArray([\n *    new FormControl()\n * ], {updateOn: 'blur'});\n * ```\n *\n * ### Adding or removing controls\n *\n * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, or `removeAt` methods\n * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the\n * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate\n * the `FormArray` directly, as that will result in strange and unexpected behavior such\n * as broken change detection.\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar FormArray = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormArray, _super);\n    function FormArray(controls, validatorOrOpts, asyncValidator) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this, coerceToValidator(validatorOrOpts), coerceToAsyncValidator(asyncValidator, validatorOrOpts)) || this;\n        _this.controls = controls;\n        _this._initObservables();\n        _this._setUpdateStrategy(validatorOrOpts);\n        _this._setUpControls();\n        _this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Get the {@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Get the {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.at = /**\n     * Get the {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (index) { return this.controls[index]; };\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.push = /**\n     * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (control) {\n        this.controls.push(control);\n        this._registerControl(control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.insert = /**\n     * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (index, control) {\n        this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n        this._registerControl(control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.removeAt = /**\n     * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (index) {\n        if (this.controls[index])\n            this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.setControl = /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (index, control) {\n        if (this.controls[index])\n            this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n        if (control) {\n            this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n            this._registerControl(control);\n        }\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(FormArray.prototype, \"length\", {\n        /**\n         * Length of the control array.\n         */\n        get: /**\n         * Length of the control array.\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function () { return this.controls.length; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     *  Sets the value of the {@link FormArray}.

You don't need to add a special selector.\n *\n * You can export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key\n * (ex: `#myForm=\"ngForm\"`). This is optional, but useful.  Many properties from the underlying\n * {\\@link FormGroup} instance are duplicated on the directive itself, so a reference to it\n * will give you access to the aggregate value and validity status of the form, as well as\n * user interaction properties like `dirty` and `touched`.\n *\n * To register child controls with the form, you'll want to use {\\@link NgModel} with a\n * `name` attribute.  You can also use {\\@link NgModelGroup} if you'd like to create\n * sub-groups within the form.\n *\n * You can listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has\n * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event will be emitted with the original form\n * submission event.\n *\n * In template driven forms, all `<form>` tags are automatically tagged as `NgForm`.\n * If you want to import the `FormsModule` but skip its usage in some forms,\n * for example, to use native HTML5 validation, you can add `ngNoForm` and the `<form>`\n * tags won't create an `NgForm` directive. In reactive forms, using `ngNoForm` is\n * unnecessary because the `<form>` tags are inert. In that case, you would\n * refrain from using the `formGroup` directive.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nvar NgForm = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgForm, _super);\n    function NgForm(validators, asyncValidators) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        _this.submitted = false;\n        _this._directives = [];\n        _this.ngSubmit = new EventEmitter();\n        _this.form =\n            new FormGroup({}, composeValidators(validators), composeAsyncValidators(asyncValidators));\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgForm.prototype.ngAfterViewInit = /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function () { this._setUpdateStrategy();

If used\n * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n * control.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nvar NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        _this.control = new FormControl();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        _this._registered = false;\n        _this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        _this._parent = parent;\n        _this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        _this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        _this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(_this, valueAccessors);\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n        get: /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function () {\n            return this._parent ?

It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n *\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`\n * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error\n * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator\n * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used\n * for notification emissions in general.\n *\n * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>\n * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled\n *                                               // with async scheduler by default...\n *\n * intervals\n * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame\n * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.\n *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';\n * });\n *\n * @see {@link delay}\n *\n * @param {IScheduler} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.\n * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,\n * but with provided scheduler.\n *\n * @method observeOn\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction observeOn(scheduler, delay) {\n    if (delay === void 0) { delay = 0; }\n    return function observeOnOperatorFunction(source) {\n        return source.lift(new ObserveOnOperator(scheduler, delay));\n    };\n}\nexports.observeOn = observeOn;\nvar ObserveOnOperator = (function () {\n    function ObserveOnOperator(scheduler, delay) {\n        if (delay === void 0) { delay = 0; }\n        this.scheduler = scheduler;\n        this.delay = delay;\n    }\n    ObserveOnOperator.prototype.call = function (subscriber, source) {\n        return source.subscribe(new ObserveOnSubscriber(subscriber, this.scheduler, this.delay));\n    };\n    return ObserveOnOperator;\n}());\nexports.ObserveOnOperator = ObserveOnOperator;\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nvar ObserveOnSubscriber = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(ObserveOnSubscriber, _super);\n    function ObserveOnSubscriber(destination, scheduler, delay) {\n        if (delay === void 0) { delay = 0; }\n        _super.call(this, destination);\n        this.scheduler = scheduler;\n        this.delay = delay;\n    }\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.dispatch = function (arg) {\n        var notification = arg.notification, destination = arg.destination;\n        notification.observe(destination);\n        this.unsubscribe();\n    };\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.prototype.scheduleMessage = function (notification) {\n        this.add(this.scheduler.schedule(ObserveOnSubscriber.dispatch, this.delay, new ObserveOnMessage(notification, this.destination)));\n    };\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.prototype._next = function (value) {\n        this.scheduleMessage(Notification_1.Notification.createNext(value));\n    };\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.prototype._error = function (err) {\n        this.scheduleMessage(Notification_1.Notification.createError(err));\n    };\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.prototype._complete = function () {\n        this.scheduleMessage(Notification_1.Notification.createComplete());\n    };\n    return ObserveOnSubscriber;\n}(Subscriber_1.Subscriber));\nexports.ObserveOnSubscriber = ObserveOnSubscriber;\nvar ObserveOnMessage = (function () {\n    function ObserveOnMessage(notification, destination) {\n        this.notification = notification;\n        this.destination = destination;\n    }\n    return ObserveOnMessage;\n}());\nexports.ObserveOnMessage = ObserveOnMessage;\n//# sourceMappingURL=observeOn.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./node_modules/rxjs/operators/observeOn.js\n// module id = 73\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nfunction isDate(value) {\n    return value instanceof Date && !isNaN(+value);\n}\nexports.isDate = isDate;\n//# sourceMappingURL=isDate.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./node_modules/rxjs/util/isDate.js\n// module id = 74\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?

You can pass either an array of\n * Observables, or put them directly as arguments. Passing an empty array will result\n * in Observable that completes immediately.\n *\n * `concat` will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without\n * changing or affecting them in any way. When that Observable completes, it will\n * subscribe to then next Observable passed and, again, emit its values. This will be\n * repeated, until the operator runs out of Observables. When last input Observable completes,\n * `concat` will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator\n * emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out\n * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,\n * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.\n *\n * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete\n * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed.

The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the\n     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n     * done.\n     *\n     * The output of `bindCallback` is a function that takes the same parameters\n     * as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output function\n     * is called with arguments, it will return an Observable. If `func` function\n     * calls its callback with one argument, the Observable will emit that value.\n     * If on the other hand callback is called with multiple values, resulting\n     * Observable will emit an array with these arguments.\n     *\n     * It is very important to remember, that input function `func` is not called\n     * when output function is, but rather when Observable returned by output\n     * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes AJAX request, that request\n     * will be made every time someone subscribes to resulting Observable, but not before.\n     *\n     * Optionally, selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`. That function\n     * takes the same arguments as callback, and returns value\n     * that will be emitted by Observable instead of callback parameters themselves.\n     * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as array,\n     * selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as callback would.\n     * This means you can imagine default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)\n     * as function that aggregates all its arguments into array, or simply returns first argument,\n     * if there is only one.\n     *\n     * Last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when call\n     * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n     * passed to callback will be emitted. By default subscription to Observable calls `func`\n     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as last parameter will defer call to input function,\n     * just like wrapping that call in `setTimeout` with time `0` would. So if you use async Scheduler\n     * and call `subscribe` on output Observable, all function calls that are currently executing,\n     * will end before `func` is invoked.\n     *\n     * When it comes to emitting results passed to callback, by default they are emitted\n     * immediately after `func` invokes callback. In particular, if callback is called synchronously,\n     * then subscription to resulting Observable will call `next` function synchronously as well.\n     * If you want to defer that call, using `Scheduler.async` will, again, do the job.\n     * This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can, in a sense, ensure that `func`\n     * always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n     *\n     * Note that Observable created by output function will always emit only one value\n     * and then complete right after. Even if `func` calls callback multiple times, values from\n     * second and following calls will never appear in the stream. If you need to\n     * listen for multiple calls, you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or\n     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n     *\n     * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property), that context will be set\n     * to the same context that output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`\n     * is called as method of some object, in order to preserve proper behaviour,\n     * it is recommended to set context of output function to that object as well,\n     * provided `func` is not already bound.\n     *\n     * If input function calls its callback in \"node style\" (i.e. first argument to callback is\n     * optional error parameter signaling whether call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}\n     * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.\n     * `bindCallback` will treat such functions without any difference and error parameter\n     * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>\n     * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)\n     * var getJSONAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);\n     * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');\n     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Receive array of arguments passed to callback</caption>\n     * someFunction((a, b, c) => {\n     *   console.log(a);

The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the\n     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n     * done. The callback function is expected to follow Node.js conventions,\n     * where the first argument to the callback is an error object, signaling\n     * whether call was successful. If that object is passed to callback, it means\n     * something went wrong.\n     *\n     * The output of `bindNodeCallback` is a function that takes the same\n     * parameters as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output\n     * function is called with arguments, it will return an Observable.\n     * If `func` calls its callback with error parameter present, Observable will\n     * error with that value as well. If error parameter is not passed, Observable will emit\n     * second parameter. If there are more parameters (third and so on),\n     * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.\n     *\n     * Optionally `bindNodeCallback` accepts selector function, which allows you to\n     * make resulting Observable emit value computed by selector, instead of regular\n     * callback arguments. It works similarly to {@link bindCallback} selector, but\n     * Node.js-style error argument will never be passed to that function.\n     *\n     * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,\n     * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to\n     * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed\n     * with proper {@link Scheduler} provided as optional third parameter. Scheduler\n     * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.\n     * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where\n     * Scheduler works exactly the same.\n     *\n     * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context\n     * of returned function, when it is called.\n     *\n     * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means\n     * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive\n     * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions\n     * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or\n     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n     *\n     * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.\n     * \"Node.js-style\" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for\n     * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,\n     * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.\n     *\n     * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance\n     * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.\n     * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as \"present\", when value\n     * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty\n     * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error\n     * with that value. This means usually regular style callbacks will fail very often when\n     * `bindNodeCallback` is used.

This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\n * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n * );\n * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>\n * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\n * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\n * var bmi = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(weight, height, (w, h) => w / (h * h));\n * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\n *\n * // With output to console:\n * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\n * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\n * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\n *\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link merge}\n * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\n * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\n * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\n * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=null] The IScheduler to use for subscribing to\n * each input Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n * @static true\n * @name combineLatest\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction combineLatest() {\n    var observables = [];\n    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n        observables[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n    }\n    var project = null;\n    var scheduler = null;\n    if (isScheduler_1.isScheduler(observables[observables.length - 1])) {\n        scheduler = observables.pop();\n    }\n    if (typeof observables[observables.length - 1] === 'function') {\n        project = observables.pop();\n    }\n    // if the first and only other argument besides the resultSelector is an array\n    // assume it's been called with `combineLatest([obs1, obs2, obs3], project)`\n    if (observables.length === 1 && isArray_1.isArray(observables[0])) {\n        observables = observables[0];\n    }\n    return new ArrayObservable_1.ArrayObservable(observables, scheduler).lift(new combineLatest_1.CombineLatestOperator(project));\n}\nexports.combineLatest = combineLatest;\n//# sourceMappingURL=combineLatest.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./node_modules/rxjs/observable/combineLatest.js\n// module id = 347\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar Observable_1 = require('../../Observable');\nvar concat_1 = require('../../observable/concat');\nObservable_1.Observable.concat = concat_1.concat;\n//# sourceMappingURL=concat.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./node_modules/rxjs/add/observable/concat.js\n// module id = 348\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?

If your event target does not match any of the ones listed,\n     * you should use {@link fromEventPattern}, which can be used on arbitrary APIs.\n     * When it comes to APIs supported by `fromEvent`, their methods for adding and removing event\n     * handler functions have different names, but they all accept a string describing event type\n     * and function itself, which will be called whenever said event happens.\n     *\n     * Every time resulting Observable is subscribed, event handler function will be registered\n     * to event target on given event type. When that event fires, value\n     * passed as a first argument to registered function will be emitted by output Observable.\n     * When Observable is unsubscribed, function will be unregistered from event target.\n     *\n     * Note that if event target calls registered function with more than one argument, second\n     * and following arguments will not appear in resulting stream. In order to get access to them,\n     * you can pass to `fromEvent` optional project function, which will be called with all arguments\n     * passed to event handler. Output Observable will then emit value returned by project function,\n     * instead of the usual value.\n     *\n     * Remember that event targets listed below are checked via duck typing. It means that\n     * no matter what kind of object you have and no matter what environment you work in,\n     * you can safely use `fromEvent` on that object if it exposes described methods (provided\n     * of course they behave as was described above). So for example if Node.js library exposes\n     * event target which has the same method names as DOM EventTarget, `fromEvent` is still\n     * a good choice.\n     *\n     * If the API you use is more callback then event handler oriented (subscribed\n     * callback function fires only once and thus there is no need to manually\n     * unregister it), you should use {@link bindCallback} or {@link bindNodeCallback}\n     * instead.\n     *\n     * `fromEvent` supports following types of event targets:\n     *\n     * **DOM EventTarget**\n     *\n     * This is an object with `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` methods.\n     *\n     * In the browser, `addEventListener` accepts - apart from event type string and event\n     * handler function arguments - optional third parameter, which is either an object or boolean,\n     * both used for additional configuration how and when passed function will be called. When\n     * `fromEvent` is used with event target of that type, you can provide this values\n     * as third parameter as well.\n     *\n     * **Node.js EventEmitter**\n     *\n     * An object with `addListener` and `removeListener` methods.\n     *\n     * **JQuery-style event target**\n     *\n     * An object with `on` and `off` methods\n     *\n     * **DOM NodeList**\n     *\n     * List of DOM Nodes, returned for example by `document.querySelectorAll` or `Node.childNodes`.\n     *\n     * Although this collection is not event target in itself, `fromEvent` will iterate over all Nodes\n     * it contains and install event handler function in every of them. When returned Observable\n     * is unsubscribed, function will be removed from all Nodes.\n     *\n     * **DOM HtmlCollection**\n     *\n     * Just as in case of NodeList it is a collection of DOM nodes.

As a result you will get a special kind of an Observable - a {@link ConnectableObservable}. It can be\n * subscribed multiple times, just as regular Observable, but it won't subscribe to the source Observable at that\n * moment. It will do it only if you call its `connect` method. This means you can essentially control by hand, when\n * source Observable will be actually subscribed. What is more, ConnectableObservable will share this one subscription\n * between all of its subscribers. This means that, for example, `ajax` Observable will only send a request once,\n * even though usually it would send a request per every subscriber. Since it sends a request at the moment of\n * subscription, here request would be sent when the `connect` method of a ConnectableObservable is called.\n *\n * The most common pattern of using ConnectableObservable is calling `connect` when the first consumer subscribes,\n * keeping the subscription alive while several consumers come and go and finally unsubscribing from the source\n * Observable, when the last consumer unsubscribes. To not implement that logic over and over again,\n * ConnectableObservable has a special operator, `refCount`. When called, it returns an Observable, which will count\n * the number of consumers subscribed to it and keep ConnectableObservable connected as long as there is at least\n * one consumer. So if you don't actually need to decide yourself when to connect and disconnect a\n * ConnectableObservable, use `refCount`.\n *\n * The second mode is invoked by calling `multicast` with an additional, second argument - selector function.\n * This function accepts an Observable - which basically mirrors the source Observable - and returns Observable\n * as well, which should be the input stream modified by any operators you want. Note that in this\n * mode you cannot provide initialized Subject as a first argument - it has to be a Subject factory. If\n * you provide selector function, `multicast` returns just a regular Observable, instead of ConnectableObservable.\n * Thus, as usual, each subscription to this stream triggers subscription to the source Observable. However,\n * if inside the selector function you subscribe to the input Observable multiple times, actual source stream\n * will be subscribed only once. So if you have a chain of operators that use some Observable many times,\n * but you want to subscribe to that Observable only once, this is the mode you would use.\n *\n * Subject provided as a first parameter of `multicast` is used as a proxy for the single subscription to the\n * source Observable. It means that all values from the source stream go through that Subject. Thus, if a Subject\n * has some special properties, Observable returned by `multicast` will have them as well. If you want to use\n * `multicast` with a Subject that is one of the ones included in RxJS by default - {@link Subject},\n * {@link AsyncSubject}, {@link BehaviorSubject}, or {@link ReplaySubject} - simply use {@link publish},\n * {@link publishLast}, {@link publishBehavior} or {@link publishReplay} respectively. These are actually\n * just wrappers around `multicast`, with a specific Subject hardcoded inside.\n *\n * Also, if you use {@link publish} or {@link publishReplay} with a ConnectableObservables `refCount` operator,\n * you can simply use {@link share} and {@link shareReplay} respectively, which chain these two.\n *\n * @example <caption>Use ConnectableObservable</caption>\n * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\n * const connectableSeconds = seconds.multicast(new Subject());\n *\n * connectableSeconds.subscribe(value => console.log('first: ' + value));\n * connectableSeconds.subscribe(value => console.log('second: ' + value));\n *\n * // At this point still nothing happens, even though we subscribed twice.\n *\n * connectableSeconds.connect();\n *\n * // From now on `seconds` are being logged to the console,\n * // twice per every second. `seconds` Observable was however only subscribed once,\n * // so under the hood Observable.interval had only one clock started.\n *\n * @example <caption>Use selector</caption>\n * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\n *\n * seconds\n *     .multicast(\n *         () => new Subject(),\n *         seconds => seconds.zip(seconds) // Usually zip would subscribe to `seconds` twice.\n *                                         // Because we are inside selector, `seconds` is subscribed once,\n *     )                                   // thus starting only one clock used internally by Observable.interval.\n *     .subscribe();\n *\n * @see {@link publish}\n * @see {@link publishLast}\n * @see {@link publishBehavior}\n * @see {@link publishReplay}\n * @see {@link share}\n * @see {@link shareReplay}\n *\n * @param {Function|Subject} subjectOrSubjectFactory - Factory function to create an intermediate Subject through\n * which the source sequence's elements will be multicast to the selector function input Observable or\n * ConnectableObservable returned by the operator.\n * @param {Function} [selector] - Optional selector function that can use the input stream\n * as many times as needed, without causing multiple subscriptions to the source stream.\n * Subscribers to the input source will receive all notifications of the source from the\n * time of the subscription forward.\n * @return {Observable<T>|ConnectableObservable<T>} An Observable that emits the results of invoking the selector\n * on the source stream or a special {@link ConnectableObservable}, if selector was not provided.\n *\n * @method multicast\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction multicast(subjectOrSubjectFactory, selector) {\n    return multicast_1.multicast(subjectOrSubjectFactory, selector)(this);\n}\nexports.multicast = multicast;\n//# sourceMappingURL=multicast.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./node_modules/rxjs/operator/multicast.js\n// module id = 503\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar Observable_1 = require('../../Observable');\nvar observeOn_1 = require('../../operator/observeOn');\nObservable_1.Observable.prototype.observeOn = observeOn_1.observeOn;\n//# sourceMappingURL=observeOn.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./node_modules/rxjs/add/operator/observeOn.js\n// module id = 504\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar observeOn_1 = require('../operators/observeOn');\n/**\n *\n * Re-emits all notifications from source Observable with specified scheduler.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Ensure a specific scheduler is used, from outside of an Observable.</span>\n *\n * `observeOn` is an operator that accepts a scheduler as a first parameter, which will be used to reschedule\n * notifications emitted by the source Observable.
